# Hart Code Katas

A Kata is a small exercise designed to improve a skill.  
Take a little time to improve your coding skills by trying the following Kata 

## Fibonacci

Your task is to write code that implements the fibonacci sequence (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ....)

It's a common coding exercise done by CS101 students and software development interviewees.  In the real world, you might know Fibonacci from the Agile story sizing sequence.  Or you might know him from the 1990s underground music scene in Paris where as a DJ he was infamous for gradually speeding up the tempo until it was a sonic blur.  Either way, you're probably familiar with the Fibonacci sequence.  If not, google it. 

Do it in any language you want, any way you want.  What is your favorite language, how do you like to indent?  Are you succinct or verbose?  What do you aim for: straightforwardness, efficiency, cleverness, maintanability, or what?  Do you ever write comments or test your code?

The goal is to express your own personal style.  It isn't necessarily to come up with the cleanest or most efficient implementation (unless that's what your all about).  Have fun with it (unless that's not you.)
